This is the exercise code for learning the book:

ðŸ“™ *Data Structures and Algorithms in Python * by Michael Goodrich.

ISBN: 978-1-118-54958-2

https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+in+Python-p-9781118549582

And this book has been really helpful for improving my understanding on Python, also the classical data structure.

It is not so light, such i only push the progress to Ch.10 Mapping. 

If there're any bulk of free time, I would try to finish it.
